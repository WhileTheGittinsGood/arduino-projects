fuse 5v connections from power supply:
	20 AWG max current = ~1.5A
	18 AWG max current = ~2.3A



set bottom half of a vertically mounted rgb led strip to a user defined color
and gradually reduce the saturation of that user defined color in the top half
fade from user defined color to white at the highest LED

use three potentiometers to control hue (0-255), saturation (0-255), value (0-255)
or use a fourth to control the LED that starts the fade to white

-start with the values of the three potentiometers

-assign the value of potentiometer to the first led 
 or first half of the strip or LED defined by potentiometer

-loop while there are LEDs remaining
	-take the saturation value and and increment it by a negative value
		-hue and value potentiometer values will remain the same
	-assign the new adjusted values to the next LED



use light color sensor to determine ambient light color and set it to
the hue value of LED strip
